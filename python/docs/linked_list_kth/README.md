Added function: kth_from_end to the linked list class

## Whiteboard Process
![whiteboard](./code7.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
The function added has a Big O time of O(2n) because there is 2 while loops: one to find the length of the list and the other to calculate where the index desired is and return that value
