# Singly Linked List
Created a linked list class that can make a linked list with the functionality to add values and print all the values of the linked list and what each node points to

## Challenge
Create a linked list class

## Approach & Efficiency

wrote a very basic linked list class following tutorials. big O for time is O(1) because it is independent of the size of the input and for space its O(n) for the includes function


## API

insert(value) - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes(value) - returns true/false whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

str() - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
